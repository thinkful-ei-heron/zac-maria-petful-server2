## About
This app simulates the adoption of cats and dogs. These are the only two animals allowed in the shelter. The app works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis according to the animals that came to the shelter first. People can adopt a cat or a dog, but they may only adopt the animal that came to the shelter first. In addition, people who want to adopt are also put in a queue so they can adopt when it's their turn.
